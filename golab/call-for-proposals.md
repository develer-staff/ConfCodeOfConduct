### Event Description


GoLab is a comprehensive conference on Go programming that started in 2015, organized by developers for developers.
Since 2022, we have held GoLab and RustLab as a co-located conference, but this year they are back-to-back with a 1-day overlap.
It is organized by Develer, a software company based in Florence, Italy.

GoLab will be an **in-person event**. In this edition you will find talks and workshops.

We'll have two types of talks, a shorter one, the **25 min Discovery** talk, and a longer one, the **40 min Deep-dive** talk.

The Discovery talk is for the speaker who has found something cool and wants to share it with the world and inspire other developers.

Instead, the Deep-dive talk is intended to present and explain a topic in which the speaker is an expert. 

The workshops are 3 hours long and focus on practical case studies.

If you are subjected to, or notice someone else being subjected to, behavior that violates this Code of Conduct, please don't hesitate to fill out the Code of Conduct Incident Form (on the website) or contact the organizers.

### CFP Description

While we are open to considering any application, we would like our speakers to present **original content**.

We will accept the following types of talks:


* 25 min - Discovery talks
* 40 min - Deep-dive talks
* 3 hours - Workshops

## Talks

The **Discovery talk** is for the speaker who has found something cool and wants to share it with the world and inspire other developers. There is no question time in this format.

Instead, the **Deep-dive talk** is intended to present and explain a topic that the presenter is an expert on and/or wants to share in more detail. The presenter can use the entire time for the talk or reserve a few minutes for questions.

## Workshop

A workshop is more hands-on. The presenter can engage the audience in a hands-on tutorial on a topic/technology. Attendees may be asked to set up their environment in advance.

We expect at least 20 people to attend all workshops.

## Topics

GoLab is open to any Go related topic. Examples include cloud and networking, language and ecosystem, devices and platforms, security. Cross-topic proposals are also welcome.

If you have a particularly interesting talk that doesn't fit into one of the suggested topics, feel free to submit it anyway and we'll be happy to consider it.

## We welcome first-time speakers.

In the coming months, we will offer weekly online office hours for all accepted speakers, where you can talk to us and ask your questions directly.

We will offer 1 to 1 rehearsals, either online or in person at the Develer offices (Calenzano, near Florence), where you can practice your talk and get suggestions.

## After you have sent your proposal

We'll review your proposal as soon as possible and give you some feedback.

Let's make a great conference together!
